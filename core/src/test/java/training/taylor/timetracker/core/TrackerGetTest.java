================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Empty Catch Block - CWE-390
Issue: The Exception is caught but is not handled. This exception handler swallows a potentially critical runtime error, thereby hiding it.
Solution: Include appropriate action in the catch block. If the exception is not recoverable, it should be logged and the program should terminate or recover based on the program's requirement.

Vulnerability: Improper Validation of Array Index - CWE-129
Issue: A potential OutOfBoundsException at 'entries.get(index)'. If the index is outside the bounds of the 'entries' array, it will throw an exception.
Solution: Always validate user-provided inputs that will be used as array indices. Check that the index is within the bounds before accessing the array.

Vulnerability: Incorrect Boolean Assignment - CWE-480
Issue: The condition 'if (valid = true)' is actually an assignment instead of a comparison. It always evaluates to true and so the if block will always be executed.
Solution: Be wary of using single equals (=) inside if conditions, if a comparison is intended use double equals (==) instead.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate Normal Operation

Test Name: testGetValidIndex
Description: This test should verify that retrieving an entry at a valid index returns the expected TimeEntry.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and populate the instance with a known set of TimeEntry objects.
  Act: Call the get() method with a valid index.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is identical to the expected TimeEntry object.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the get() method correctly retrieves TimeEntry objects from valid positions within the list. This is essential to ensure proper manipulation and access to individual entries.

Scenario 2: Validate Handling of Invalid Indexes

Test Name: testGetInvalidIndex
Description: This test verifies that an invalid index passed to the get() method will throw the appropriate exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and populate the instance with a known set of TimeEntry objects.
  Act: Call the get() method with an index that falls outside the valid range.
  Assert: Use JUnit to expect an IndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the get() method protects against invalid accesses by throwing appropriate exceptions. This ensures data integrity in the face of misuse or unexpected application states.

Scenario 3: Validate Empty List Handling

Test Name: testGetFromEmptyList
Description: This test verifies that calling get() on an empty list throws the appropriate exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class without adding any TimeEntry objects to it.
  Act: Call the get() method with any index.
  Assert: Use JUnit to expect an IndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the get() method handles the edge case of an empty list appropriately, preventing undefined behavior and data access violations. This maintains the robustness and stability of the system under edge cases.

Scenario 4: Validate Large Index Handling

Test Name: testGetLargeIndex
Description: This test should verify that calling get() with a large index beyond the existing size of the list throws an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and populate the instance with a known set of TimeEntry objects.
  Act: Call the get() method with a large index value outside the range of the populated list.
  Assert: Use JUnit to expect an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the get() method effectively protects against data access violations even with large indices. This is crucial to guard the software against unexpected runtime errors due to index overflow.
