================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: An attacker can manipulate direct object references to gain unauthorized access to data.
Solution: All users' inputs should be validated and sanitized on the server-side before processing.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: This can allow attackers to decrypt sensitive data by exploiting the known weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithm used.
Solution: Use modern cryptographic algorithms that have been widely reviewed and proven to be strong, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encryption.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: A successful SQL injection exploit can interfere with the queries that an application makes, misuse the identity, and cause reputational damage.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which makes SQL Injection much more difficult by distinguishing between code and data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check Non-null Time Entry Added Successfully

Details:
  TestName: addNonNullTimeEntrySuccessfully
  Description: This test is meant to verify that a non-null TimeEntry object is successfully added.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a non-null TimeEntry object.
    Act: Invoke the 'add' method with the non-null TimeEntry object.
    Assert: Use the size of the entries list before and after the 'add' method call to check if a new entry was added.
Validation:
  This aims to verify that a non-null TimeEntry object is correctly added. This is significant because it proves that our 'add' method works for valid objects.

Scenario 2: Check Null Time Entry Not Added

Details:
  TestName: doesNotAddNullTimeEntry
  Description: This test checks to ensure that null TimeEntry objects are not added.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null TimeEntry object.
    Act: Invoke the 'add' method with the null TimeEntry object.
    Assert: Verify that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:
   This confirms that adding a null TimeEntry object is not possible, thus ensuring our 'add' method is safe from null pointer exceptions.

Scenario 3: Check Multiple Time Entries Added Successfully

Details:
  TestName: addMultipleTimeEntriesSuccessfully
  Description: This test is designed to verify that multiple non-null TimeEntry objects can be added successfully.
  Execution:
   Arrange: Create multiple non-null TimeEntry objects.
   Act: Invoke the 'add' method with each TimeEntry object created.
   Assert: Compare the size of the entries list before and after adding the TimeEntry object to verify if each one is added successfully.
Validation:
  This verifies the 'add' method's ability to handle more than one TimeEntry object, therefore confirming its flexibility.

Scenario 4: Check Impact on Existing Time Entries After Adding a New Time Entry

Details:
  TestName: doesNotAffectExistingTimeEntriesWhenNewEntryIsAdded
  Description: This test verifies that existing TimeEntry objects in the list are not impacted when a new TimeEntry object is added.
  Execution:
   Arrange: Create a new TimeEntry object and an existing entries list with TimeEntry objects.
   Act: Call the 'add' method with the new TimeEntry object.
   Assert: Compare the state of the existing TimeEntry objects before and after the 'add' method call to establish that they are not affected.
Validation:
   This is significant because it ensures data integrity after adding new entries.
