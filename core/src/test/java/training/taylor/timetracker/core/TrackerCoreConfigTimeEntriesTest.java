================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: If, in future development, sensitive information is added directly to TimeEntry objects and directly returned as a list to untrusted components, there may be risk of exposing sensitive information.
Solution: Avoid storing sensitive information directly within TimeEntry objects. If sensitive data is necessary, ensure proper access control is implemented and data leakage is minimized.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-932)
Issue: If in future development, if TimeEntries are related to specific users or sessions and are retrievable directly, there would be a risk of unauthorized data access.
Solution: Implement access controls and session management. Do not allow direct referencing of objects related to sensitive data.

"""
Scenario 1: Validate the Empty List Returned by the Method

Details:
  TestName: testTimeEntriesReturnEmptyList
  Description: This test is meant to check if the `timeEntries` method is properly initializing and returning an empty ArrayList.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as no input parameters or external dependencies are required for this particular method.
  Act: Invoke the `timeEntries` method.
  Assert: Check if the returned list is indeed empty.
Validation:
  The aim is to verify that a new empty list of TimeEntry objects is being returned. This is expected because the method is initialized to return a new ArrayList without any elements.

Scenario 2: Verify the Type of List Returned by the Method

Details:
  TestName: testTimeEntriesReturnType
  Description: This test is meant to check if the `timeEntries` method is returning a list of the correct type, which should be ArrayList.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as no input parameters are external dependencies are required for this particular method.
  Act: Invoke the `timeEntries` method.
  Assert: Check if the returned object is an instance of ArrayList.
Validation:
  The aim is to verify that the object returned is an instance of ArrayList. This is expected based on the method implementation, which clearly shows the instantiation of an ArrayList.

Scenario 3: Verify List Mutability

Details:
  TestName: testTimeEntriesListMutability
  Description: This test is meant to check if the list returned by `timeEntries` method is mutable - that is, if elements can be added or removed from the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as no input parameters or external dependencies are required for this particular method.
  Act: Invoke the `timeEntries` method. Subsequently, attempt to add an object of TimeEntry to the returned list.
  Assert: Check if the list size has increased by one after the addition.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the list returned by `timeEntries` method allows modifications.
  This test is crucial since, in the context of managing TimeEntries, being able to add to the list of TimeEntries is fundamental to the application's behavior.
