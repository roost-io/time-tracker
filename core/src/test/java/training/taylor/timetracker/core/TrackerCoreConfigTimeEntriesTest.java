================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: Unintentionally committed debug code poses a security risk, as attackers can take advantage of debug functionality or information.
Solution: Ensure no debug code is left in the final committed version. Tools like SonarQube can help identify debug code or statements.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: If the application expands to include database access or sensitive functionality, using hard-coded credentials can be a serious security risk. Such easily-accessible credentials are a potential target for unauthorized access.
Solution: Avoid using hard-coded credentials, consider using strong encryption to protect them if they must be stored, or better yet, use identity services that tokenize these secrets.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If an exception is thrown and the application exposes detailed error information, these messages might reveal sensitive information or the application's internals to an attacker.
Solution: Ensure no sensitive information is disclosed through error messages. Error details should be logged server-side for review by developers.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: If the application were to create files or directories in the future, applying insecure default permissions may expose resources to unintended actors.
Solution: Ensure files and directories are created with secure default permissions and are later adjusted as necessary.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for TimeEntries Initial State

Details:  
  TestName: testTimeEntriesInitialState
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method correctly returns an empty ArrayList of TimeEntry at the initial state. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable as no initial setup required for an empty ArrayList.
  Act: Invoke the timeEntries() method without any parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if timeEntries() method returns an empty ArrayList of TimeEntry.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the timeEntries() method correctly initializes an empty ArrayList. It is essential for ensuring correct functionality as the method should return an empty list before any TimeEntry objects have been added.

Scenario 2: Test for Non-Null Return Value

Details:  
  TestName: testTimeEntriesReturnValue
  Description: This test is designed to check if timeEntries() method always returns a non-null object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable as no initial setup is required due to the method's nature.
  Act: Invoke timeEntries() method without any parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value of the timeEntries() method is not null.
Validation: 
  The assertion is checking for a non-null return value which is fundamental to avoid NullPointer exceptions in subsequent method calls or operations. This test is vital to ensure the robustness of the application.

Scenario 3: Test for Return Type Consistency

Details:  
  TestName: testTimeEntriesReturnType
  Description: The aim of this test is to verify that timeEntries() method consistently returns an ArrayList of TimeEntry type, adhering to its contract.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable as no initial setup required due to the nature of the method.
  Act: Invoke timeEntries() method without any parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value of the method is always of ArrayList of TimeEntry type.
Validation: 
  It is important to verify that the method maintains consistency in the return type. This ensures that other parts of the code expecting this data type won't encounter ClassCast Exceptions.
